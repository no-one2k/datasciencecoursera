Getting and Cleaning Data. Course Project #1
===================

File run_analysis.R follows theese instructions from course project #1 of Getting and Cleaning Data:



You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



Result of runing run_analysis.R is file result.txt. Its structure is described in code_book.md.
